# Phylogeographic reconstruction of Heartland virus 
Long distance migration and spatial dispersal of Heartland virus were assessed using a Bayesian discrete phylogeographic analysis to generate a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. 
These analyses were conducted in BEAST v1.10, annotated in RStudio v4.5.1, and visualized in Kepler.gl. 
XML file (BEAST v1.10 input), Combined Log File (BEAST v1.10 output), code for RSTUDIO to annotate MCC tree, and the Annotated MCC Tree File (RStudio output - Kepler input) are available in this folder.
