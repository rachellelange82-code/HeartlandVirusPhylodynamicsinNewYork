# Protein Modeling for Heartland virus was conducted using Expasy SWISS-MODEL software. 
The following reference structures were used:
* NSs, small segment=Rift Valley Fever virus NSs [8wcm.1.A]
* GP, medium segment=Dabie bandavirus GP [8ilq.1]
* RDRP, large segment=Dabie bandavirus RDRP [7alp.1.A]
  
Homology reports and PBD format reports from SWISS-MODEL can be found in this folder for each protein.
